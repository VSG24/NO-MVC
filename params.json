Documentation is not ready.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n* Routing (AltoRouter)\r\n* Templates (Twig)\r\n* Caching\r\n* Improved security by separating the document root directory\r\n* Plenty of common useful functions\r\n* Fast and lightweight (Core framework size is under **100 KB**)\r\n\r\n**Requirements:**\r\n* PHP 7+ (PHP 5.6.X may work but it's  **not**  recommended)\r\n* Ability to change document root of your web server\r\n* Ability to redirect all non static requests to `wwwroot/index.php` (`.htaccess` and `web.config` files are already included)\r\n\r\n**Important Note:**\r\n\r\nYou must set your web server's document root to `wwwroot` folder!\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor: Vahid Amiri Motlagh (http://atvsg.com) - 2016",
